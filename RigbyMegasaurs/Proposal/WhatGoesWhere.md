### LARS 
- In depth
+ Mainly about the sample selection, goal and so on
+ My contributions:
    - LARS Paper 1. SDSS spectroscopy, determine redshift zer-point, 
      metallicity by different diagnostics, electron temperature where 
      possible, 
    - LARS Paper V. Mention esp. @Jones2013 and papers herein. The history of 
      apparent optical depth. Mention Scarlata and Prochaska? Probably not. 
      Only limited space. 


### Haro 11 / ESO 338

+ nearby starbursts
+ LyC leakage (candidate ESO338, actual, Haro 11)
+ Haro 11 C - what, WR stars? X-ray binaries?


Figures
-------

### LARS 

+ The "money shot".
+ Figure with LARS 13 and LARS 14?
+ Figure with covering fracs for all the galaxies in the sample?

### Haro 11 / ESO 338

+ Slit map
+ line profile with model
+ Prelim. color excess plot
+ Grism-screenshots?

Figures
-------

+ GPs in SDSS and HST-ACS.
+ Haro 11 or ESO-338, probably Haro11, from Matt's paper, my version.
+ Maybe my figure of Haro 11 CoverFracs along with it?
