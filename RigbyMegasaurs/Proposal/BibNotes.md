======================================

On LAEs:
--------

Malhotra et al 2012:
:    *Sizing up Lyα and Lyman Break Galaxies.* Ly$\alpha$ Emitters (LAEs), selected for Ly$\alpha$, at redshifte $2.25 < z < 6$ are constant and compact in size. This is unlike LBGs which vary strongly in size with redshift. Suggests that the compactness is critical to Ly$\alpha$ emission.

Dawson et al 2007
:    *A Luminosity Function of Lyα-emitting Galaxies at z ~ 4.5*. Basically: No drop in LAE luminosity function in redshift range $3 < z < 6.5$, which is otherwise the case for LBGs. So reionization deffo done by now.

Hathi et al. 2008
:    *Starburst Intensity Limit of Galaxies at z~=5-6*. Basically: Starburst intensities are more or less unchanged from local values up till $z \sim 5-6$. (So why is Ly$\alpha$?)

Rhoads et al 2014
:    *The Dynamical Masses, Densities, and Star Formation Scaling Relations of Lyα Galaxies*.  Dynamical masses, between $10^9$ and $10^{10} M_{\odot}$. LAEs show sSFRs comparable to those of local starbursts, although they are of lower mass. (Interesting, then, that Ly$\alpha$ escape is so much lower in local starbursts).

Tilvi et al 2009
:    *A Physical Model of Lyα Emitters*. Gist: Mass accretion, rather than gas mass, is what determines SFR and hence LAE luminosity.

Finkelstein et al 2008
:    *Effects of Dust Geometry in Lyα Galaxies at z = 4.4*. Basically: Dust in a clumpy medium could extinguish UV continuum, while letting Lyα scatter more or less freely through the inter-clump medium,letting EWs in some LAEs go *above* intrinsic values.

Finkelstein et al 2011
:    *Dust Extinction and Metallicities of Star-forming Lyα Emitting Galaxies at Low Redshift*. In short: Low-redshift LAE analogs are metal poor.

Erb et al 2014
:    *The Lyα Properties of Faint Galaxies at z ~ 2-3 with Systemic Redshifts and Velocity Dispersions from Keck-MOSFIRE*. 36 galaxies at redshift 2-3. Masses are 10^8-10^10 Msun.  Almost all redshifted in Lya emission. Outflows necessary (and dominant?) for Lya EW.

Atek et al. 2014
:    *Influence of physical galaxy properties on Lyα escape in star-forming galaxies*. 24 nearby/low redshift Lya emitters. Give a formula for the dependence of dust on fesclya WE SHOULD TOTES CHEK THIS IN ELARS PAPER.

Atek et al 2008
:    Also something with dust. But the 2014 paper seems to have a more sophisticated version of the same.


Green Peas
----------

Yang et al 2015 
:    GPs show strong Lya emission. 9 of 12 galaxies would be
    selected in high z LAE samples. MY ARGUMENT: GP SAMPLES ARE NEW; AND WHILE 
    LOTS OF THINGS SUGGEST THE SAME LYA RT MECHANISMS; IT REMAINS YET TO BE
    SEEN. I HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND THE CODE READY TO DO THIS; MALHOTRA AND
    RHOADS OR ALTERNATIVELY JASKOT AN OEY HAVE THE DATA

Henry et al 2015
:    *Lyα Emission from Green Peas: The Role of Circumgalactic Gas Density, Covering, and Kinematics*. Conclude that low HI coldens, not all the other stuff that we were talking about, is what allows for Lya escape in GPs. WE CAN TRY OUR ANALYSIS AND SEE IF IT ACTUALLY AGREES; AS WE HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY SAID THAT THE TOTAL COVERING FERACTION HAD TO BE LESS THAN UNITY.

Amorin et al 2010
:    *On the Oxygen and Nitrogen Chemical Abundances and the Evolution of the "Green Pea" Galaxies*. Gist: GPs have unusual N/O ratios, givingmethod dependency of measured metllicity- The authors suggest that inflow fuels star formation (like in Tilvi et al 2009?) and, paired with metal-rich outflows due to stellar feedback, keeps the metallicity low.  Also, mass-metallicity relation offfset downwards by $\sim 0.3$ dex compared to olocal star forming galaxies in SDSS.


Izotov 2011
:    *Star-forming galaxies with hot dust emission in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)*. Found galaxies, GPs, with very hot dust, T$\sim$ 1000 K. RELEVANT FOR C+, OBSCURED STAR FORMATION.

Amorin 2012b
:    Spectroscopy shows that Halpha in GPs decomposes into several components, meaning that GPs are a "turbulent mess", that is, probably either turbulent or interacting; "Train wrecks" like tht eons in LARS. VERY MUCH THE SAME I AM DOING FOR ESOHARO; SHOULD MENTION?
